# MDS
This projects shows the solutions for MDS and MPIDS problems using a hybrid local search algorithm (H-LS). Given a graph G=(V,E) and a dominating set DS (a subset of V), all vertices not in DS must be connected to at least one vertice in DS (for the MDS problem), or a vertex that is not in DS must have half of its adjacencies in DS (for the MPIDS problem).
