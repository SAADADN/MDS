# MDS
This project shows the solutions for MDS and MPIDS problems using a hybrid local search algorithm (H-LS). Given a graph G=(V,E) and a dominating set DS (a subset of V), all vertices not in DS must be connected to at least one vertice in DS (for the MDS problem), or a vertex that is not in DS must have half of its adjacencies in DS (for the MPIDS problem). 

#MDS_constraints
This file check the MDS constaint for n vertices, where n is the input size. 

#MDS_socialVerification.py
This file verifies the results of the MDS based on social networks (Google plus, and Pokec), as shown in Table 6 of our paper. 

#MPIDS_verification.py 
This file verifies the results of the MPIDS for social netwoks that were reported in Table 9 of our paper.

#udgsVerification.py 
This file verifies the results of the MDS based on UDGs that were reported in Table 7 of our paper.
